# Transfer Learning on Single Class (Protest)

This folder contains our baseline appraoch for applying transfer learning techniques on protesting event classification. 

**Two different Transfer Learning techniques are examined**:

- Fine-Tuning
- Use CNN as a Feature Extractor

## Structure

All files are in Jupyter Notebook format that contains both code and result.

Please see:

- Image and Dataset Pre-processing in: pre-processing.ipynb
- Transfer Learning: transfer_learning_baseline.ipynb

## Run the Code
Launch Jupyter Notebook from directory where these files are contained, run all or sections of code in Jupyter Notebook environment.

# AI_CS640_BU

This repo has all the ongoing projects I participated in CS640 Artificial Intelligence during 2019 Spring at BU.

There are 3 projects included in this course. Currently I have finished the first project: 

Building and training a neural network using backpropagation algo. 

## Neural Network

I used **python** to implement this project. Please check *neural network* folder. 

There are four objectives that I achieved:

- Understand how neural networks work 
- Implement a simple neural network 
- Apply backpropagation algorithm to train a neural network 
- Understand the role of different parameters of a neural network, such as epoch and learning rate.

# AI_CS640_BU

This repo has all the projects I participated in CS640 Artificial Intelligence during 2019 Spring at BU.

There are 3 projects included in this course.

- Build and train a neural network using backpropagation algo, L2 regularization and k-fold cross validation. 

- Classify news image using transfer learning.
- Implement a 3D Tic-Tac-Toe game with minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning technique.

## Neural Network

We used **Python** and related libraries to implement this project. Please check *neural network* folder. 

There are four objectives that we achieved:

- Understand how neural networks work 
- Implement a simple neural network 
- Apply backpropagation algorithm to train a neural network 
- Understand the role of different parameters of a neural network, such as epoch and learning rate

## News Image Classification

Social media has become one of our best source to understand what is going on around us, from all over the world. If there is any protest taking place, we can analyze the images posted to social media and extracrt useful info.

For our second project, we would like to use <b>Python</b> to help us design and implement a prototype of an expert system which can help the police to dynamically analyze the image flow online and locate if there is any protest happening. Also, we conducted multi-label object classification and can help identify if there are fire or protest signs presented.

Plesae check our corresponding folder for proejct definition, problems we tried to address, and our full report.

## 3D Tic-Tac-Toe

This is my third project coded on myself with <b>JAVA</b>.

3D tic-tac-toe is a strategy board game, generally designed for two players taking turns and compete against each other. It is similar to the traditional 3 by 3 tic-tac-toe but is played in a cubic array of cells. For this particular game, I used 4 by 4 by 4 board setting with medium-level game play difficulty.

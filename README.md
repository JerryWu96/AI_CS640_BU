# AI_CS640_BU

This repo has all the ongoing projects I participated in CS640 Artificial Intelligence during 2019 Spring at BU.

There are 3 projects included in this course. Currently we have finished two of them: 

Build and train a neural network using backpropagation algo, L2 regularization and k-fold cross validation. 

Classify news image using transfer learning.

## Neural Network

We used **Python** and related libraries to implement this project. Please check *neural network* folder. 

There are four objectives that we achieved:

- Understand how neural networks work 
- Implement a simple neural network 
- Apply backpropagation algorithm to train a neural network 
- Understand the role of different parameters of a neural network, such as epoch and learning rate

## News Image Classification

Social media has become one of our best source to understand what is going on around us, from all over the world. If there is any protest taking place, we can analyze the images posted to social media and extracrt useful info.

For our second project, we would like to design a prototype of an expert system which can help the police to dynamically analyze the image flow online and locate if there is any protest happening. Also, we conducted multi-label object classification and can help identify if there are fire or protest signs presented.

Plesae check our corresponding folder for proejct definition, problems we tried to address, and our full report.

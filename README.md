# AI_CS640_BU

This repo has all the ongoing projects I participated in CS640 Artificial Intelligence during 2019 Spring at BU.

There are 3 projects included in this course. Currently we have finished two of them: 

Build and train a neural network using backpropagation algo, L2 regularization and k-fold cross validation. 

Classify news image using transfer learning.

## Neural Network

We used **Python** and related libraries to implement this project. Please check *neural network* folder. 

There are four objectives that we achieved:

- Understand how neural networks work 
- Implement a simple neural network 
- Apply backpropagation algorithm to train a neural network 
- Understand the role of different parameters of a neural network, such as epoch and learning rate

## News Image Classification

TBA
